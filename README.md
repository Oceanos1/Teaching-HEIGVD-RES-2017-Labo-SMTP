# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2017-Labo-SMTP

## Objectives
This program allows a user to send pranks by email: they can be sent from any email adress to a list of other adresses. The SMTP server and port via which the emails are sent can be configured by the user, as can all the adresses.

## Instructions

* All the config files are contained within the `./config/` directory. 
* The adresses of the victims should be entered into the `victimes.RES.utf8` file.
* The `config.properties` file can be used to configure the SMTP server, port, witness email to be CC'd and the number of adress groups to be used.
* The `messages.utf8` file should contain the messages you wish to send. The first line of a message should be a subject using the format `Subject: example subject`. After the subject, one blank line should be left before the body of the message is written. To end a message, another blank line should be added followed by a line containing only the symbols `==`.
