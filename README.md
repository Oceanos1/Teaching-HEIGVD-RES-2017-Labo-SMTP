# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2017-Labo-SMTP

## Objectives
This program allows a user to send pranks by email: they can be sent from any email adress to a list of other adresses. The SMTP server and port via which the emails are sent can be configured by the user, as can all the adresses.

## Instructions

* All the config files are contained within the './config/' directory. 
* The adresses of the victims should be entered into the 'victimes.RES.utf8' file.
* The 'config.properties' file can be used to configure the SMTP server, port, witness email to be CC'd and the number of adress groups to be used.
* The 'messages.utf8' file should contain the messages you wish to send. The first line of a message should be a subject using the format 'Subject: example subject'. After the subject, one blank line should be left before the body of the message is written. To end a message, another blank line should be added followed by a line containing only the symbols '=='.
